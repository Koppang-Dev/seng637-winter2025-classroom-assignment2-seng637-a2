# 1 Introduction
This lab report outlines our test case design and our testing strategy for unit testing. We used Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Analysis as our black-box testing techniques for this assignment. Additionally, we have described how we will test each function, how we partitioned it, and how we will combine boundary analysis. In the `Test Cases Developed` section, we explain each test we developed for the given functions in greater detail. 

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy
We attempted to use Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Analysis for each of the tested functions. For Equivalence Partitioning the goal was the reduce redunancy by testing disjoint classes and esuring the entired input set is covered. For example, we would have a parition for invalid ranges and a partition for valid ranges. For Boundary Analysis, the following: Below Lower Bounday, Lower Boundary, Value Above Lower Boundary, Nominal Value, Below Upper Boundary, Upper Bounday and Above Upper Boundary. When we combine these approaches, for each indiviual test cases we can keep a sinlge nominal value, which would also inlcude the the Lower Boundary, Upper Boundary, Above Lower Boundary, Below Upper Boundary and Nominal Value. Therefore, in most situations we would be left with test cases covering a value below the lower boundary (invalid partition), a nominal value (a valid partition) and a Above Upper Boundary (a valid partition). Sometimes, testing both the Lower Boundary and Upper Boundary was more practical to ensure the boundary analysis was fully robust. The following chart will describe how we split up each class function and our objective and reasoning for each split. The section proceeding the chart will go into greater detail about each test for each function.


# üìä Test Design Approach

## 1. Combine(Range range1, Range range2)**

| **Overview** | Creates a new range by combining two existing ranges. Either range can be `null`, and if both are `null`, the return value is `null`. |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Equivalence Partitioning** |Both ranges are non-null <br> One range is null <br> Both ranges are null |
| **Boundary Analysis** | Test the lower and upper bounds <br> Test a nominal value|
| **Tests Completed** | Checked when both ranges are null <br> Checked when one range is null <br> Checked when both are valid |

# 4 Mocking Benefits and Drawbacks **
Mocking in this assignment was extremely useful. It allowed us to isolated components such as DataUtilities without having depndencies such as 2DValues. If we did not mock then we first would have had to test 2DValues to ensure it was working correctly extensively, or it also would have caused DataUtilitiesTests to fail. Futhermore, mocking is utilized when developing tests that use other external dependencies such as databases and APIs to avoid side affects and have quicker and more efficient tests. The downsides to mocking is that the mocks are not behaving precisely like real dependencies. We manually set the result of a mock, making it less realistic and setting up our tests to correspond with that mock. In a real-world situation, the mocked dependency may have varying results, allowing us to have more robust testing.




# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

We designed the test cases together initially. Then Riley wrote the tests for the Range class, and Yousef wrote the more complex test cases for the DataUtilities class. When someone used a mocked object for one class, if that mock was also needed for other tested functions, they would write those functions. Since, in the end, Riley was struggling to run the project pulling from GitHub, he focused on the lab report while Yousef cleaned up the code and test cases.


# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

We encountered a couple of key challenges. First, Riley had difficulty running the test suites when pulling from GitHub. For some reason, the way the project was set up did not work on his device, but it worked on Yousefs. Since this happened at the end, it did not affect Riley too much. Yousef would just re-run the tests on his device to get results for the tests for the lab report. Another challenge was figuring out how many tests we needed for each function. We knew it was key to utilize equivalence partitioning and boundary analysis. However, it was better to use both methods andecific cases. This experience helped us to think critically about SUT designs and how to delegate the workload better. Lastly, the most significant challenge for testing the Range class was that its constructor was incorrectly set up. This was causing a lot of future tests to fail, and without testing the constructor first, it made it extremely difficult to understand where the problem was coming from.


# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself
We felt that the lab was pretty easy to follow. It was effective practice for black box testing strategies, overall a good experience.
